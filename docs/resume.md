## About Me

I'm a Software QA Engineer with a background in **robotics, mechatronics, and automation**, now focused on ensuring software quality through testing, validation, and CI integration. I bring a hardware-rooted mindset to software QAâ€”balancing structured testing with agile adaptability.

At **Cushman & Wakefield**, I led diagnostics and QA documentation efforts for robotics systems. Today, I build test suites and API validation tools in **Python**, contribute to CI-ready QA frameworks, and refine my automation skillset with **Selenium**, **Postman**, and **Pytest**.
