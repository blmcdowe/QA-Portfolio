# QA Portfolio

Welcome to my QA Engineering Portfolio! This repository showcases my experience with automated testing tools including Playwright, Selenium, and Python. Each project demonstrates a key area of quality assurance, and all are runnable via simple CLI tools.

## Projects

### [Hacker News UI Test Suite](projects/hacker-news-ui-tests/)
Automated UI test suite built with Playwright and Python. Validates functionality and sorting of Hacker News headlines. Tests include end-to-end scenarios with selectors, assertions, and browser management.

### [Selenium Login Test](projects/selenium-login-tests/)
Browser automation test using Selenium to validate a login form. Includes credential input, form submission, and success message verification.

### [API Test Template](projects/api-tests-template/)
Scaffold for REST API testing with Python and `requests`. Includes authentication, response validation, and extensible structure for future API scenarios.

---

## CLI Tools

Located in the [`cli-tools/`](cli-tools/) directory, these Python scripts let you easily run each test suite from the command line:

- `run_ui_tests.py` — Runs the Hacker News UI tests.
- `run_selenium_login.py` — Executes the Selenium-based login automation test.
- `run_api_tests.py` — Placeholder for running API test suite.

Usage:

python run_ui_tests.py

python run_selenium_login.py

python run_api_tests.py
